## Full Screen: [Opentecture Bookmarks View-a-line by Cataegory]( https://opentecture.github.io/mindmapping/sandbox/opentecture-bookmarks/view-a-line-bookmarks-by-category/index.html )


## Concept

This script is a side project of the [gbXML to JSON Lines]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/#sandbox/gbxml-to-json-lines/README.md) project.

It is a work-in-progress continuation of exploring, manipulating and hacking the [JSON Lines file format]( http://jsonlines.org/ ) in unusual, useful and fun ways.


### Objectives

* Access very large numbers of bookmarks
* View contents of many sites in a speedy fashion
* Categorize and tag bookmarks with ease and speed
* Speed up identification with descriptions added on-the-fly
* Curate the output using comments

### Features include:

* Read JSON Lines files created by [Opentecture Bookmarks Add-a-line]( https://opentecture.github.io/mindmapping/#sandbox/opentecture-bookmarks/add-a-line-bookmarks/README.md )
* Display tree menu of bookmarks with HTML details elements
* For every bookmark allow
	* Display web page in an iframe
	* Open web page in new tab
	* Edit bookmark json
* Save edits to new file / Open local file for testing


## To Do / Wish List

* 2019-03-24 ~ Build an API
	* See https://pinboard.in/api/
* 2019-02-17 ~ Replace all date references with UTC strings
* 2019-02-17 ~ Upgrade IDs to UUIDs
* 2019-02-17 ~ Replace 'tags' with 'categories' / Add new separate 'tags' element
* 2019-02-12 ~ Turn titles of things like university names to links to suitable page
* 2019-02-11 ~ Add ability to do screen capture of pages and save / save to Imgur? for reuse instead of iframes


## Notes

* Best to have the JavaScript console open so you can view the errors. There are many issues still to be dealt with in displaying web sites in iframes
	* Also iframes issues with HTTP/HTTPS are different depending on whether you are running locally or on a sever
* After editing a JSON bookmark, you must save to a file and then reload the page. Future release will be more convenient.
* Be sure to create and keep back up files of the data files
* Tags currently being used as catagories. This will change
* Does not yet handle file not found errors well
* Adding new bookmarks will happen in future releases

## Issues

* handle CORS and other iframe errors better

From [The case for single character git commit message prefixes]( https://smalldata.tech/blog/2018/10/04/the-case-for-single-character-git-commit-message-prefixes )

* B, indicates a bugfix.
* F, indicates a feature or a change - this will most likely be the majority of the commits.
* a, code formatting change.
* c, comments and or documentation.
* D, dependency updates.
* R, code refactoring, note that this is different from r below.
* r, proven code refactoring - this is the original meaning of the mathematical term refactoring, where it can be mathematically proven that the code change does not change any functionality.
* T, test cases and/or test improvements
* !, unknown - i.e. for when you really need to make that commit because there's a horde of zombies waiting outside.
